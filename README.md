## Installation

* Obtained the initial code for the Horiseon page
* Refactored the HTML index file to follow general HTML semantics
    * Primarily altered listed "div" elements and added alt elements to each image
* Edited the CSS style sheet to follow the new layout of the HTML elements
    * Merged repetitive elements and titles within CSS to simplify the code
* Ensured the HTML and CSS edits did not change the deployed webpage itself
